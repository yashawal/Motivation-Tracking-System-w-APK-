# Motivation Tracker

This repository contains two main components:

1. **Motivation Tracking System (Python):**  
   - Located at the root as `Motivation Tracking System.py`.  
   - This script logs activities and calculates motivation scores.

2. **APK Conversion Extension:**  
   - Located in the `apk/` folder.  
   - Contains JSON, JavaScript, and other files that attempt to convert the Python project into an Android APK.
   - **Note:** The current APK build process is experimental and the installation stalls at 50%.
